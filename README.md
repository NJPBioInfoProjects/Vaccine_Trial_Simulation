# Vaccine_Trial_Simulation
This repository contains a computational approach to evaluate a veterinary vaccine trial for Hepatitis E in pigs. The project focuses on determining the sample size (N) required to achieve a 90% chance of detecting a statistically significant reduction in infection rates, using a permutation test.

Project Overview

The problem assumes:

The probability of infection for untreated pigs is pc = 0.5.

The probability of infection for vaccinated pigs is pv = 0.1.

Statistical significance is evaluated at the Î± = 0.05 level.

The objective is to:

Simulate infection outcomes for control and treatment groups.

Implement a permutation test to evaluate differences in infection rates.

Determine the sample size  that provides a 90% chance of detecting a significant reduction in infection rates.

Key Features
